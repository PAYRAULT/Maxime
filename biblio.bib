	abstract = {Security is a concern in the design of a wide range of embedded systems. Extensive research has been devoted to the development of cryptographic algorithms that provide the theoretical underpinnings of information security. Functional security mechanisms, such as security protocols, suitably employ these mathematical primitives in order to achieve the desired security objectives. However, functional security mechanisms alone cannot ensure security, since most embedded systems present attackers with an abundance of opportunities to observe or interfere with their implementation, and hence to compromise their theoretical strength. This paper surveys various tamper or attack techniques, and explains how they can be used to undermine or weaken security functions in embedded systems. Tamper-resistant design refers to the process of designing a system architecture and implementation that is resistant to such attacks. We outline approaches that have been proposed to design tamper-resistant embedded systems, with examples drawn from recent commercial products.},

The overall security of a network cannot be determined by simply counting the number of vulnerabilities. To accurately assess the security of networked systems, one must understand how vulnerabilities can be combined to stage an attack. We model such composition of vulnerabilities through attack graphs. By simulating incremental network penetration, and propagating attack likelihoods, we measure the overall security of a networked system. From this, we score risk mitigation options in terms of maximizing security and minimizing cost. We populate our attack graph models from live network scans and databases that have knowledge about properties such as vulnerability likelihood, impact, severity, and ease of exploitation. Our ﬂexible model can be used to quantify overall security of networked systems, and to study cost/beneﬁt tradeoﬀs for analyzing return on security investment.},

Whereas defenders must protect a large, diverse set of cybersystems containing an unknown number of vulnerabilities of various types, attackers need only find one or a few exploitable vulnerabilities to mount a successful attack. One promising approach that can shift the balance in the defenders' favor is to create uncertainty for attackers by dynamically changing system properties in what is called a cyber moving target (MT). MT techniques seek to randomize system components to reduce the likelihood of a successful attack, add dynamics to a system to reduce the lifetime of an attack, and diversify otherwise homogeneous collections of systems to limit the damage of a large-scale attack. In this article, the authors review the five dominant domains of MT techniques available today as research prototypes and commercial solutions. They present the techniques' strengths and weaknesses and make recommendations for future research that will improve current capabilities.},

Adopting moving target defense (MTD) helps thwart cyber attacks by continuously changing the attack surface. There are numerous MTD techniques proposed in various domains (e.g., virtualized network, wireless sensor network), but there is still a lack of methods to assess and compare the effectiveness of them. Security models, such as an attack graph (AG), provide a formal method of analyzing the security, but incorporating MTD techniques in those security models has not been studied. In this paper, we incorporate MTD techniques into a security model, namely a hierarchical attack representation model (HARM), to assess the effectiveness of them. In addition, we use importance measures (IMs) for deploying MTD techniques to enhance the scalability. Finally, we compare the scalability of AG and HARM when deploying MTD techniques, as well as changes in performance and security in our experiments.},

	doi = {10.1109/CDC.2013.6759960},
	abstract = {In a decoy-based moving target defense (MTD), a computer network introduces a large number of virtual decoy nodes in order to prevent the adversary from locating and targeting real nodes. Since the decoys can eventually be identified and their Internet Protocol (IP) addresses blacklisted by the adversary, current MTD approaches suggest that the IP addresses of the real and decoy nodes should be randomly refreshed and reassigned over time. Refreshing and reassigning the IP addresses, however, disrupts services such as TCP/IP that rely on the IP address. We introduce an analytical approach to MTD and choosing the optimal randomization policy in order to minimize disruptions to system performance. Our approach consists of two components. First, we model the interaction between the adversary and a virtual node as a sequential detection process, in which the adversary attempts to determine whether the node is real or a decoy in the minimum possible time. We compute the optimal strategy for the adversary to decide whether the node is real or a decoy, and derive closed-form expressions for the expected time to identify the real node using this strategy. Second, we formulate the problem of deciding when to randomize the IP addresses, based on a trade-off between reducing the probability of detecting the real node and minimizing the disruption to network services, as an optimal stopping problem. We derive the optimal randomization policy for the network and analyze the detection probability, expected number of connections lost due to IP randomization, and expected time between randomizations under the proposed policy. Our results are illustrated via a simulation study using real-world data from NMAP, a software tool used to identify decoy nodes. Our simulation study indicates that our IP randomization policy reduces the probability of detection while minimizing the number of connections that are disrupted by the randomization.},
